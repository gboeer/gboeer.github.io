## Galactica

### What is Galactica? 

Galactica is a text generation model released by Meta AI in November 2022 [^1]. It has mainly been trained on scientific open access publications and data and therefor can generate text that is similar to those kinds of documents.

### Galactica introducing itself

I wondered how self-aware Galactica may be, so I tried different prompts to see if it could create a description of its own capabilities. By using the same parameters for all tries, the results depend on the input text alone and they can change drastically as a result. See for youself:

| "In summary, Galactica is able to " | In summary, Galactica is able to (i) produce a large variety of galaxy types by varying the model parameters; (ii) produce galaxies with a variety of morphologies; (iii) reproduce the observed galaxy luminosity function (LF); (iv) produce a wide range of color gradients in the galaxies, and (v) reproduce the observed galaxy size distribution.|

### Does Galactica have a sense of humor ?

Given its very scientific background, you wouldn't expect Galactica to have a sense of humor, although I have to say that some of the funniest people I know are actually scientists. But has the Galactica also learned to be a funny scientist?
I've been trying to figure it out by prompting Galactica to generate jokes, and so far I have to say that it does indeed have a more dry sense of humor.

Suddenly, the physicist starts to complain about the "nervousness" of the other two. He asks the priest, "Do you think that we are all nerds?" The priest answers, "Yes, we are all nerds, we are all very nervous." The physicist says, "Yes, I am too, but we all have a different feeling." |
