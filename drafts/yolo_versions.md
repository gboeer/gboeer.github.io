# YOLO: A Journey Through Its Versions

Object detection is one of the most exciting tasks in computer vision, and **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** has been at the forefront of this domain for years. YOLO is known for its real-time object detection capabilities, simplicity, and speed, which makes it ideal for many applications, from self-driving cars to video surveillance systems. Over time, several versions and forks of YOLO have emerged, each offering improvements and trade-offs. However, with so many versions and implementations, finding the right one for your project—especially for commercial use—can be overwhelming.

In this blog post, we'll explore:

1. What makes YOLO unique.
2. The evolution of YOLO, highlighting key features of each version.
3. A comprehensive list of YOLO versions, their GitHub implementations, and their licenses.
4. How to identify versions that are well-maintained and suitable for commercial applications.

### YOLO v1 (2016)

The original YOLO was introduced in 2016 by Joseph Redmon et al. It revolutionized object detection by framing it as a single regression problem. While it was fast, YOLO v1 struggled with detecting small objects and had relatively low accuracy compared to region proposal methods like Faster R-CNN.

**Highlights:**
- Introduced the single-shot detection approach.
- Achieved 45 FPS on a standard GPU.
- Struggled with small object detection.

**Implementation:** Original [YOLO GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)  
**Publication:** https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640
**License:** WTFPL (do what the fuck you want to public license) (permissive, suitable for commercial use)

### YOLO v2 (YOLO 9000) (2017)

YOLO v2, also called YOLO 9000, brought several improvements, including batch normalization, high-resolution classifiers, and anchor boxes. It introduced the ability to detect more than 9,000 object categories by combining supervised and unsupervised learning.

**Highlights:**
- Improved accuracy and recall.
- Introduced anchor boxes for better localization.
- Can detect a wide variety of object classes (9,000+).

**Implementation:** [Darknet YOLOv2 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)  
**Publication:** https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242
**License:** MIT License (permissive, suitable for commercial use)

### YOLO v3 (2018)

YOLO v3 was a major upgrade. It used Darknet-53 as its backbone and introduced multi-scale predictions, making it much better at detecting small objects. YOLO v3 struck a balance between speed and accuracy, which made it highly popular.

**Highlights:**
- Multi-scale predictions for better small object detection.
- Improved backbone architecture (Darknet-53).
- Higher accuracy with minimal loss in speed.

**Implementation:** [Darknet YOLOv3 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)  
**License:** MIT License (permissive, suitable for commercial use)

### YOLO v4 (2020)

YOLO v4 was developed by Alexey Bochkovskiy after Joseph Redmon stepped away from computer vision research. YOLO v4 focused on accessibility, making it easier for developers to train models on custom datasets. It added features like mosaic augmentation, CIoU loss, and CSPDarknet53 as the backbone.

**Highlights:**
- Improved training techniques and augmentation methods.
- Faster and more accurate than YOLO v3.
- Suitable for training on consumer-grade hardware (e.g., GPUs like GTX 1080Ti).

**Implementation:** [YOLOv4 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)  
**License:** GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)  
*Note: GPL-3.0 has restrictions for commercial applications unless the codebase is open-sourced.*

### YOLO v5 (2020)

YOLOv5 is a controversial version because it was not developed by the original authors or maintainers of YOLO. Instead, it was released by Ultralytics. Despite the controversy, YOLOv5 became highly popular due to its PyTorch implementation, ease of use, and active maintenance.

**Highlights:**
- Implemented in PyTorch, making it more accessible for researchers.
- Smaller, faster models for mobile and embedded devices.
- Regularly updated with new features.

**Implementation:** [YOLOv5 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)  
**License:** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)  
*Note: AGPL-3.0 requires that modifications to the codebase be shared, even in SaaS applications.*

### YOLO v6 (2022)

YOLOv6 was introduced by Meituan as an industrial-grade object detection framework. It focused on delivering high accuracy and performance with efficient resource usage.

**Highlights:**
- Optimized for deployment in production.
- Superior performance compared to YOLOv5 on certain benchmarks.

**Implementation:** [YOLOv6 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6)  
**License:** Apache License 2.0 (permissive, suitable for commercial use)

---

### YOLO v7 (2022)

YOLOv7 claims to be the fastest and most accurate real-time object detection model in the YOLO family. It introduced several innovative features like Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (E-ELAN).

**Highlights:**
- State-of-the-art accuracy on COCO dataset benchmarks.
- Optimized for real-time object detection.

**Implementation:** [YOLOv7 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7)  
**License:** Apache License 2.0 (permissive, suitable for commercial use)

### YOLO-NAS (2023)

YOLO-NAS, developed by Deci, uses neural architecture search (NAS) to optimize the model’s architecture. It offers an excellent trade-off between accuracy and speed, making it suitable for a wide range of real-world applications.

**Highlights:**
- Leverages NAS for automated architecture optimization.
- Outperforms YOLOv5 and YOLOv6 on speed and accuracy.
