Hey, I'm Gordon — an AI developer with a skeptical mind, a strong coffee habit, and a passion for solving real-world problems using computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning.

## What I Do

- 🧠 **AI & Deep Learning** – I develop robust models for object detection, segmentation, and visual analysis, with a focus on real-time and embedded applications.
- 🔍 **Computer Vision** – From fisheye distortion to fine-grained feature tuning, I tackle tough vision problems in domains like robotics. underwater vision and ecological informatics.
- 🧰 **MLOps & Deployment** – I’m not just about models. I build clean, reproducible, and GPU-ready pipelines using Docker, Python, PyTorch, and MLflow.
- 🕹️ **Robotics & Automation** – Currently working on automating inspection processes, transitioning from manual control to intelligent damage detection and reporting.
- ✍️ **Technical Writing** – I break down complex models (like SSD or YOLO) into understandable code walkthroughs and blog posts. If it's useful and practical, I write about it.

## Why This Site?

This site is my digital workbench — a place to:

- Share **practical solutions** to real computer vision problems.
- Publish **code**, **tools**, and **experiments** I wish I had found earlier.
- Document my **projects**, **side quests**, and **lessons learned** (the hard way).
