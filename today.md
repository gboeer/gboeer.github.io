        Today is National Swap Ideas Day, encouraging us to share creative or helpful ideas with others and trade them for their thoughts in return. This observance celebrates the magic that happens when communities of people join forces, bouncing sketches and eureka moments off each other to spark new innovations. Sometimes all it takes is pairing one suggestion with another to create something bigger and more tangible than either idea alone.

        Today is a special day for all software developers! In 1947, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper" target="_blank">Grace Hopper</a> documented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_(engineering)#History" target="_blank">"first actual case of bug being found"</a> - a moth that was found stuck in a relay. While Grace Hopper didn't coin the term "bug" originally (e.g. it was already used in technical jargon by Thomas Edison and appeared in Isaac Asimov's story "Catch That Rabbit"), this incident made the term famous in computing. The incident was meticulously documented with the actual moth taped into the logbook.   </p>
